Partializr v1.0.0

Partializr works as a client side (Javascript) alternative to the popular
Apache Server Side Include (SSI). The objective is having all the benefits
of the SSI (being able to use "partials" in your HTML code, keeping your code DRY)
without having to tweak or configure (or even have) an Apache server, as it all happens
on the client side.

Usage: to start using Partializr you just need to include this file in the head
of you HTML page. Notation for the "includes" (partials) is exactly the same as
the one used by Apache: <!--#include virtual="..." -->

Considerations for this v1.0.0
- No nested partials (partials inside of partials)
- Partials don't take parameters
- Partial files should be contained inside of a folder named "partials"
- Partials folder is a direct sibling of the HTML files we want to process
